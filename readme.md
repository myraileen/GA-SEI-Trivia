  - _Game play technical consideration: with each browser refresh, a session token is obtained from the game's data-service (https://opentdb.com) which prevents the same question from presenting to the player during the browser session. If the player consumes the limited number of questions available, the browser would need to be refreshed. Consequently, the player could be presented with repeat questions. (A 'gold' version of this game could check the remaining number of questions in the category and automatically obtain a new session token)_  
* Guidance for how to shuffle an array was referenced from Mike Bostock's blog-post about coding the Fisher-Yates Algorithm in javascript.
