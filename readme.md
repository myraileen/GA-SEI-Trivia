# Trivia Game  

## How to play:  
* Select game options:  
  - Choose a question category  
  - Choose how many questions to play  
* **Click start!**  

### UX expected features
Upon loading the game into the browser, once a game is started, the player will be prompted with the number of questions selected from the category selected. Once game play begins:
* The next question is enabled only after choosing an answer to the current question.
* Upon answering a question the player gets feedback if their answer is correct or not and the answers score is updated.
* When all questions have been played, the player gets feedback on win status and total games won or lost and can start a new game. 
  - _Game play technical consideration: with each browser refresh, a session token is obtained from the game's data-service (https://opentdb.com) which prevents the same question from presenting to the player during the browser session. If the player consumes the limited number of questions available, the browser would need to be refreshed. Consequently, the player could be presented with repeat questions. (A 'gold' version of this game could check the remaining number of questions in the category and automatically obtain a new session token)_
